# Challenges given to myself by myself

Created each after watching through 30 minute segments of
Caleb Curry's Node.js 3 hour tutorial. During these 30 minute
long segments I would be pausing to write notes, and deconstructing
syntax I didn't understand.

## Challenge 1

Use prior notes to build a Node.js project that will print
a unique ID on start up. After that create a github repository
and push code up to github.

## Challenge 2

### 5/25/2023 6:04pm

---

Install both express and nodemon. Afterwards integrate nodemon
in start command, and then set up GET and POST methods.
Create some json for the cats to send off in GET method.

## Challenge 3

### 5/25/2023 7:09pm

Create .env file and add to .gitignore, then get dotenv to
integrate the file. Create a free MongoDB Atlas account, download
mongoose package, and integrate the DB. Connection string should
be placed in .env file.

## Challenge 4

### 5/25/2023 9:50pm

Need to add app.use(express.json) and add
app.use(express.urlencoded({extended: true})) to app.js. Create
a POST method to add a cat into the DB. Then create two GET
methods. One that will use parameters to get a cat by name, and
the other will grab all cats in the DB.

## Challenge 5

### 5/26/2023 12:27pm

Create PUT and DELETE methods to update and delete a cat. Then
integrate cors for a future front-end.

## Challenge 6

Create nested data for Cat in the form of an array called hobbies
used to store hobby objects. Hobby object will have properties for
name and description. Lastly construct a PATCH method to add hobbies
to a cat by ID.

## Challenge 7

### 5/25/2023 4:23pm

Download Typescript globally and use the cli tool to add it into
current project. Set up watch command to so that both nodemon and
Typescript will run when I save.
